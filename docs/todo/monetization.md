# Monetization TODO

## Premium Conversion Screen

Prompt users to upgrade at strategic moments.

### Triggers

- After N days of use
- When accessing premium features
- Vault size threshold
- Feature-specific gates (encryption, multi-vault?)

### Screen Content

- Value proposition
- Feature comparison (free vs premium)
- Pricing
- CTA: Subscribe / Try free

### Integration

- Polar.sh as payment provider (see `docs/financials.md`)
- License key validation
- Graceful degradation for expired licenses

## Free vs Premium Features

TBD - define what's gated:
- Encryption?
- Multi-vault?
- Cloud sync?
- Priority support?
